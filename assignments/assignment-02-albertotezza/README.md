# Second Assignment
This assignment is about classes and enum. This time you should use git.


This exercise requires you to design and implement a `Book` class, such as you can imagine as part of a software for a Library.

`Book` class should have __data members__ for:
1. ISBN (you should store ISBN as a string,
2. book title,
3. author,
4. genre (fiction, nonfiction, periodical, biography, children),
4. copyright date, and
5. data on whether or not the book is checked out.

`Book` class should also include __function members__ for:
1. Returning data members value,
2. Checking a book in and out, and
3. Constructors

Do simple validation of data intered into a Book; for example, accept ISBNs only of the form _n-n-n-x_ where _n_ is an integer and _x_ is a digit or a letter.

Please use the Book.h and Book.cpp files for class interface and implementation and main.cpp to test the functions.

If you have any question, just write on the forum of the course.
