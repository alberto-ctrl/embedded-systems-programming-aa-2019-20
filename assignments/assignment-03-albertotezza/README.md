# Third Assignment
This assignment is again about classes.
This exercise requires you to design and implement a `Patron` class, such as you can imagine as user for a Library.

`Patron` class should have __data members__ for:
1. user's name,
2. libray card number,
3. library fees (if owed).
 
`Patron` class should also include __function members__ for:
1. access this data,
2. set the fee of the user
3. return a boolean depending on whether or not the user owes a fee.

As usual do simple validation of data; for example, library fees > 0.

Please use the Patron.h and Patron.cpp files for class interface and implementation and main.cpp to test the functions.

If you have any question, just write on the forum of the course.
